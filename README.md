## Installation

The quickest way to install the dependencies is:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed instructions and a helper script for Apple Silicon users. A lightweight requirements file is also available under `requirements-test.txt` for continuous integration environments.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8 or newer
* Unix-like OS (Linux or macOS recommended)
* Optional: GPU with CUDA for deep learning models

## Quick Start

Run the main application with the default settings:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also start an experiment from a YAML configuration:

```bash
python scripts/run_experiment.py config/sample_config.yaml --backtest
```

Press `Ctrl+C` at any time to cancel the interactive CLI.

The framework automatically selects the best available device (CUDA, MPS or CPU) so it can run efficiently on most hardware without manual tweaks.

## Configuration

Configuration files live under `hyperion3/config/`. The main dataclass `HyperionV2Config` exposes settings for data sources, model parameters, trading rules and MLOps options. Edit `config/sample_config.yaml` to customise symbols, lookback windows or enabled models and load it via:

```bash
python main.py --config config/sample_config.yaml
```

### Modes

- **Train**
  ```bash
  python main.py --mode train --config config/sample_config.yaml
  ```
- **Backtest**
  ```bash
  python main.py --mode backtest --config config/sample_config.yaml
  ```
- **Live trading**
  ```bash
  python main.py --mode live --config config/sample_config.yaml
  ```

## Deployment

Real trading execution is handled by the scripts in `deployment/`. The
`live_trader.py` module connects to exchanges via CCXT and supports
both testnet and mainnet trading. Monitoring and risk management helpers
are also provided in this package.

## Architecture Overview

The code base is organised into modular packages:

- `models/` ‚Äì transformers and RL agents.
- `training/` ‚Äì training loops and callbacks.
- `evaluations/` ‚Äì backtester and financial metrics.
- `optimization/` ‚Äì AutoML utilities with FLAML and Ray Tune.
- `data/` ‚Äì downloaders, preprocessing and feature engineering tools.
- `deployment/` ‚Äì live trading engine and monitoring utilities.
- `scripts/` ‚Äì helper commands for training and testing.
- `docs/` ‚Äì additional documentation for backtesting and data handling.

A detailed Spanish overview is available in [`estructura del proyecto.txt`](estructura%20del%20proyecto.txt).

## Dataset Management

Raw datasets reside in `data/`. Use the provided preprocessing scripts to generate features and augmentations. The `DataConfig` class controls symbols, lookback windows and additional data sources such as sentiment, orderbook or on‚Äëchain metrics. See [`docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT.md`](docs/DATA_MANAGEMENT.md) for a walkthrough.


### Automated Data Updates

Run `python scripts/data_scheduler.py` to start a background scheduler that refreshes datasets periodically based on `update_frequency` from your configuration. See [`docs/SCHEDULER.md`](docs/SCHEDULER.md) for details.

## Documentation

Further guides are available under the `docs/` directory:

- [`BACKTESTER.md`](docs/BACKTESTER.md) ‚Äì advanced backtesting engine.
- [`EXPERIMENTS.md`](docs/EXPERIMENTS.md) ‚Äì running configurable experiments.
- [`VALIDATORS.md`](docs/VALIDATORS.md) ‚Äì cross‚Äëvalidation helpers.


## Testing

Run the unit tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=hyperion3 tests
```

The CI pipeline runs a reduced set of dependencies defined in `requirements-test.txt`; tests requiring missing packages will be skipped automatically.

## Deployment with Docker

A `Dockerfile` is provided to build a container image. Create the image and run Hyperion V2 as follows:

```bash
docker build -t hyperion3 .
docker run --env-file .env -it hyperion3
```

The container installs all dependencies and runs `main.py` by default. Mount volumes or customise environment variables as needed.
